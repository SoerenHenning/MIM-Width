## Evaluation

* Value in column "Heuristic" is mim-width computed by heuristic
* Value in column "Exact" is the exact mim value for the tree decomposition computed by the heuristic
* iterations = 10
* firstTieBreaker = ReducingTieBreakers::chooseMinDegree
* secondTieBreaker = FinalTieBreakers::chooseMaxNeighboursEdges
